## This is the first homework
#I add this line in a separate bran
# i begin by downloading the required data and decompressing it using the commands
wget https://downloads.yeastgenome.org/sequence/S288C_reference/genome_releases/S288C_reference_genome_Current_Release.tgz

### followed by 
tar -xzvf S288C_reference_genome_Current_Release.tgz
### now i rename the created directory "data" for convenience, i will try not to upload this to github

mv S288C_reference_genome_R64-2-1_20150113 data
## move in to new  directory
cd data
## now i try to count the number of genes, as follows. note that gene is written in column 3 of gff file

grep "chrII" saccharomyces_cerevisiae_R64-2-1_20150113.gff | cut -f 3 > col3.txt
## this extracts all coulmn 3 entries of lines which correspond to 2nd chromosome. We follow it by
grep -c "gene" col3.txt ### or alternatively grep "gene" col3.txt | wc -l 

# this gives the simple ouptut 681, which should be the number of genes in chrII. note that all entries
## of column 3 which contain the word gene, e.g tRNAgene are also included, but I think they are genes
# To count the GC content, I use the following approach. I wish to delete all characters from the file except Gs and
# Cs, then count the number of characters. Note 2 things. The header is first removed using sed,
# and I believe a new line is interpreted as a character som i remove \n in the "tr -d" command. 
# the code to run is this

cd .. ### to get back to Homework directory
sed 's/>.*//' data/S288C_reference_sequence_R64-2-1_20150113.fsa | tr "G" "C" > test.txt  # to remove header
tr -d "AT\n" < test.txt | wc -m  # gives the count of G/C. -m is for characters..
## the value is 4637676. This was a very strange method, but could not make grep work.

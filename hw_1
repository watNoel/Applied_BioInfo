## This is the first homework
#I add this line in a separate bran
# i begin by downloading the required data and decompressing it using the commands
wget https://downloads.yeastgenome.org/sequence/S288C_reference/genome_releases/S288C_reference_genome_Current_Release.tgz

### followed by 
tar -xzvf S288C_reference_genome_Current_Release.tgz
### now i rename the created directory "data" for convenience, i will try not to upload this to github.
